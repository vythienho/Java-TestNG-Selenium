 * Dependency Injection solves legacy problem with hardcoded dependencies as in the tutorial.
 * Solves the issue by injecting dependencies as needed.
 *
 * 1. Service components should be designed with base class or interface. Itâ€™s better to prefer
 * interfaces or abstract classes that would define contract for the services.
 * 2. Consumer classes should be written in terms of service interface.
 * 3. Injector classes that will initialize the services and then the consumer classes.
